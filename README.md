## Description

FriendlyNotes is a digital friendship book app where you can store all your notes, birthdays, addresses and more about your friends. 
Note down what your friend likes or dislikes, what hobbies they pursue or which idea for a christmas present you have. Or let your friend fill in the form themselves - it is all up to you.
<br>
<br>
I developed Friendlynotes as a native Android app in Kotlin using Android Studio and Gson. The app was created during my second semester as a personal project. There are still some bugs I am planning to fix in the near future.

## Impressions

The app features a list of friends you can search. Each friend can have a profile picture and several entries such as name, birthday, address, phone number and occupation. All fields except the name are optional.
If a phone number, address or birthday is saved, you can directly call the friend, see the address in your maps app or save the birthday in your calendar by tapping the respective icon on the right.
